description: I was triggered having a conversation with my collegue, which stated my makes deserve some more visibility. That inspired me to create a blog...

As we spoke about development and everyday sorrows during the crisis, we ended up 
talking about what else keeps me busy. Of course I do like to show off a little with
some [Internet of Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) projects I'm busy with in my free time, which triggered a reaction
like 'Cool, you should present that someday during a dev-thursday'.
I do like to share my code, as I also take advantage of other devs sharing their code.

## Future Posts
As this is the first post of many to come, we'll focus on some makes I did, and shed some 
light on their internals. It covers projects like
- A digital neopixel clock consisting of 3 neopixel led circles
- A weather station with a paperwhite display
  - a previous version with a color display
- ArClock and my improvements on it software wise

Lets see how things develop, and hope y'all like it!
