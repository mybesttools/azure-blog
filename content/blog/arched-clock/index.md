This is my first post on my new blog! How exciting!

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[Maker Culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture).

> The maker culture is a contemporary subculture representing a technology-based extension of 
> DIY culture[citation needed] that intersects with hacker culture (which is less concerned with 
> physical objects as it focuses on software) and revels in the creation of new devices as well 
> as tinkering with existing ones. The maker culture in general supports open-source hardware. 
> Typical interests enjoyed by the maker culture include engineering-oriented pursuits such as 
> electronics, robotics, 3-D printing, and the use of computer numeric control tools, as well as 
> more traditional activities such as metalworking, woodworking, and, mainly, its predecessor, 
> traditional arts and crafts.

You can also write code blocks here!

```js
const maker = "creatively inspired being"
```
